This is an anonymous database prepared for paper submission, designed to demonstrate the format of our database and the corresponding genealogy visualization framework.

The title of our paper is: 
MASCOT: Analyzing Malware Evolution Through A Well-curated Source Code Dataset.

Due to GitHub's file size limitations and the paper's unpublished status, all data and statistical files are incomplete. The disarmed full dataset will be published on
IEEE DataPort. The code for visualization and statistical files for MASCOT will be released on GitHub once the paper published. 

As this paper focuses on malware analysis, the compressed file Specimens.zip in this repository contains malicious Windows code!
